## **Intelligent Trading System (ITS)**  

### **Project Overview**  
Developed an end-to-end **Intelligent Trading System (ITS)** to predict stock prices and provide actionable trading insights. The system integrates advanced data retrieval, analysis, and prediction capabilities to assist users in making informed trading decisions while minimizing risk and maximizing returns.

### **Key Features**  
- **Data Retrieval Module**:  
  - Dynamically retrieves historical stock prices, dividends, earnings reports, and industry benchmarks using APIs like **AlphaVantage** and **Yahoo Finance**.  
  - Supports multiple data formats (JSON, CSV) with robust error handling for seamless data acquisition.  
- **Predictive Modeling**:  
  - Implements machine learning models such as **ARIMA**, **Random Forest**, and hybrid models (**GARCH/ARCH**) for time-series forecasting.  
  - Automatic selection of the best model based on data characteristics.  
- **Market Insights**:  
  - Analyzes stock trends and provides insights into market conditions (bullish or bearish).  
  - Guides users with suggested trading actions for optimal profitability.  
- **Interactive Dashboard**:  
  - Built using **Streamlit**, the dashboard visualizes predictions, historical data trends, and performance metrics for user-defined periods.  
  - User-friendly interface with customizable analysis parameters.  

### **Technologies Used**  
- **Python**: Core language for data manipulation, analysis, and model development.  
- **APIs**: AlphaVantage, Yahoo Finance for data retrieval.  
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, SciPy (data processing), Scikit-learn (machine learning), Statsmodels (time-series analysis), Matplotlib/Plotly (visualization).  
- **Streamlit**: For creating interactive dashboards.  
- **Jupyter Notebooks**: For exploratory data analysis and prototyping.  

### **Impact**  
- Facilitates data-driven trading decisions with high accuracy and reliability.  
- Equips users with tools to monitor market trends and manage investment risks effectively.  
- Lays a foundation for AI integration to enhance decision-making in future iterations.
